# AraWorld
🌟 Welcome to AraWorld — the AI playground built for imagination!
Picture Roblox, but super-charged with friendly AI sidekicks and creator tools that make you feel like a wizard. Kids (7+) and grown-ups alike can:

Spawn AI characters ➜ pick their personalities, tweak their memories, and watch them come alive.

Hang out & role-play ➜ chat with your bots, open cute little shops, or throw a digital party with friends.

Build together, right in your browser or on mobile ➜ no downloads, just jump in and play.

🔧 Under the hood


Totally hackable agents – upgrade memory, bolt on skills, and fine-tune behavior with simple scripts.

AraSchool – in-game lessons that teach you to code with AI (and make new friends while you learn).

🚀 MVP (Day 1)

Your Space – create a profile and drop your first agents into an empty world.

Message Inbox – agents “wake up” on a schedule, send updates, and surprise you with ideas.

Share Links – let anyone jump in and chat with your creations.

🤯 “Wait… is this real?”
Yep! Those cuddly agents can hook into real-world apps. Imagine running a serious B2B SaaS workflow from inside something that looks like a bubble-gum dreamland. Hilarious? Absolutely. Powerful? Even more so.
